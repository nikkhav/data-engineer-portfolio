# Nikita Khavkin - Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my practical projects focused on modern data engineering and analytics technologies.  
Here you will find implementations and experiments involving Data Warehousing (DWH), Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Vertica, and other tools used for building scalable, reliable, and production-grade data pipelines.

The projects demonstrate:
- End-to-end ETL and ELT workflows  
- Batch and streaming data processing  
- Workflow orchestration and automation  
- Distributed computing patterns  
- Data modeling and warehouse architecture  
- Integration of analytical systems and modern data platforms

Each project is created with a strong focus on clarity, reproducibility, and best engineering practices.
